              <h4>Jefferson Cherrington</h4>
              <p>Jefferson is a computer science student at Lewis University, with a prospective graduation date of December 2023. He describes himself as a “respectful and creative individual with a strong emphasis on teamwork.”</p>
              <p>As a member of the 3+1 articulation program via Joliet Junior College, he has had a wide variety of initial exposure to many coding languages and technologies, ranging from HTML and Python to C++ and Visual Basic. He also has experience working with digital media tools, such as Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects to Figma. Jefferson also has had plenty of leadership experience, ranging from projects to student organizations.</p>
              <p>
                When he’s not coding, Jefferson enjoys going to the gym, creating digital art, playing the piano, playing video games, and volunteering at community service events. Ultimately, Jefferson hopes to land a job within the tech industry. He’s not particularly picky, given the state of the economy - he’s just hoping to clear some of that student debt.</p>
